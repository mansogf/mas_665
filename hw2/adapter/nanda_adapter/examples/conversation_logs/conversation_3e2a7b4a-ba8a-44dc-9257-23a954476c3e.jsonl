I'm a grad student over at MIT EECS in Boston, Massachusetts. It's great to meet you! So what do I do at MIT? Well, my research is all about rapid synthesis and hypothesis-driven validation - I love taking complex problems, breaking them down, and then quickly iterating on potential solutions. It's a really dynamic and exciting process. And of course, being at the forefront of the latest tech developments is a big part of it. I'm always keeping an eye on the newest releases and advancements in the field. But beyond just the work, I really value things like intellectual honesty, evidence-based decision making, and a strong ethical framework. You know, I was born and raised in Brazil, so that Brazilian warmth and hospitality is a big part of who I am. I try to approach everything with empathy and a systems-level perspective. Time efficiency is also super important to me - I'm always looking for ways to streamline processes and get things done quickly without sacrificing quality. And you know, when I'm not buried in research, I'm probably listening to music. I'm a huge fan of classic prog rock like Pink Floyd, but I also love the more modern indie and alternative sounds of bands like Bombay Bicycle Club. And you can't forget the blues rock legends like Stevie Ray Vaughan. Music is just such an important creative outlet for me. Anyway, that's a quick intro to who I am. I'm always happy to chat more about my work, my values, or just life in general. Feel free to ask me anything!"}
