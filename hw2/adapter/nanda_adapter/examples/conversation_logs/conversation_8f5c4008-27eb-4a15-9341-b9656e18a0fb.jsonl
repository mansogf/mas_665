I'm Gabriel, nice to meet you. I'm from right here in Boston, Massachusetts - born and raised in this vibrant city. I'm an EECS grad student over at MIT, focusing on rapid prototyping and systems engineering. Always loved the energy and creativity of this place, you know? There's just something about the mix of brilliant minds, world-class institutions, and rich cultural scene that really resonates with me. Plus, the music scene is killer - I'm a huge fan of psychedelic and progressive rock, so I'm always catching shows around town. Pink Floyd, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Bombay Bicycle Club, that kind of vibe. Anyway, that's a bit about me! Let me know if you have any other questions."}
