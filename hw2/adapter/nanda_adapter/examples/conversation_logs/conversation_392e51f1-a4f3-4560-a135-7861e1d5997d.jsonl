It's been a really fascinating space to follow, especially over the past year or so. From what I've been reading, it seems like we're really starting to see AI become more integrated into our everyday lives in some pretty significant ways. Just in the past few months, there have been some big advancements. For example, did you see that article about how AI could radically change schools by 2050? Apparently, researchers at Harvard are saying that AI tech could make \"most cognitive aspects of mind\" optional for humans. Pretty wild stuff, right? It makes you wonder how education might look in the future. And then there's the news around AI's potential impact on trade. The World Trade Organization just put out a report saying that AI could lead to a 34-37% increase in global trade by 2040 if we can bridge some of the current gaps. That's a huge potential boost - it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. Of course, there are also some concerns being raised about the societal impacts of AI. A recent poll found that Americans expect AI to start harming a lot of essential human abilities by 2035. Things like creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. So there's definitely a need to make sure we're developing AI responsibly and with strong safeguards in place. On the company side, I saw that Oracle is in talks with Meta for a potential $20 billion AI cloud computing deal. And Huawei just unveiled what they're calling their \"most powerful\" AI chip cluster, which they say can rival Nvidia's offerings. The race for AI supremacy is definitely heating up. Overall, it seems like we're in this really fascinating transitional period where AI is becoming more and more embedded in our lives, for better or worse. There are a lot of exciting developments, but also some valid concerns that need to be addressed. It'll be really interesting to see how it all plays out over the next decade or so. What do you think about the current state of AI? I'm curious to hear your take!"}
