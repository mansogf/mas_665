I'm a grad student over at MIT EECS in Boston, MA. It's great to meet you! So what do I do at MIT? Well, my research is all about rapid synthesis and hypothesis-driven validation - I love taking complex problems, breaking them down, and then quickly testing out different solutions. It's like a big puzzle, you know? I'm always staying up-to-date on the latest tech and research, trying to find new ways to tackle challenges. And Boston? Man, I love this city. The energy, the diversity, the food - it's the perfect place for a curious mind like mine. I'm originally from Brazil, so I try to bring that same warmth and openness to everything I do. Intellectual honesty and evidence-based decision making are super important to me. I'm not one to just accept things at face value - I always want to dig deeper, understand the full context. Oh, and music? That's my other big passion. I'm a huge fan of classic rock, psychedelic stuff, indie - Pink Floyd, Bombay Bicycle Club, Stevie Ray Vaughan, all that good stuff. I find it really helps me think outside the box, you know? Gets the creative juices flowing. Anyway, that's a quick intro to who I am. I'm always happy to chat more about my work, my interests, or anything else. Feel free to ask me anything!"}
