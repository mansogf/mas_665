I'm originally from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil - grew up there until I was about 15 and then my family moved to the States. Boston's been my home for the past decade or so though, ever since I started my undergrad at MIT. I love the energy of this city, the mix of history and cutting-edge tech. And the music scene is pretty killer too - I'm always catching shows, whether it's indie bands at the Paradise or blues legends at Scullers. You a music fan yourself? I'm always looking for new recommendations, especially in the psychedelic/prog rock realm. Let me know if you have any favorites I should check out!"}
