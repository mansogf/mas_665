I'm originally from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil - grew up there until I came to the States for university. Ended up falling in love with Boston though, it's such a vibrant, intellectual city. The music scene is killer, I'm always catching shows at places like Paradise Rock Club or Great Scott. And of course, being part of the MIT community is pretty special. I get to work on all kinds of fascinating projects, from building new machine learning models to designing next-gen robotics systems. It's an incredible environment to be in. But I still try to hold onto my Brazilian roots - love cooking feijoada on the weekends, and nothing beats a cold Brahma on a hot summer day. So I guess you could say I'm a bit of a hybrid - a Brazilian-American Bostonian, if you will. The best of both worlds, if you ask me!"}
